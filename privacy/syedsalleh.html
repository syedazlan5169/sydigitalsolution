    <h1>Privacy Policy – Syed Salleh Family App</h1>
    <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 25 November 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the
      <strong>Syed Salleh Family App</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”, or “the app”)
      handles personal information belonging to invited family members who use
      the application. This app is <strong>strictly private</strong>, intended
      only for members of the Syed Salleh family, and is not available to the
      general public.
    </p>

    <p>
      By using this app, you agree to the collection and use of information in
      accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      The app may collect, display, or store the following types of information:
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Family Profile Information</h3>
    <p>This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names</li>
      <li>Profile photos or family photos</li>
      <li>Birthdates</li>
      <li>
        Relationship information (for example, parent/child, spouse, sibling)
      </li>
      <li>Contact details that you choose to provide</li>
      <li>
        Additional notes or family-related information you voluntarily enter
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is entered manually by family members and is intended to
      be visible only to authorized users of the app.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 User-Provided Media</h3>
    <p>
      If the app allows uploading or selecting photos, it may request access to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Photos and images stored on your device</li>
      <li>Your device’s media library or storage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Only the photos you explicitly choose inside the app are used for app
      features such as displaying profiles or slideshows.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Camera Access (If Enabled)</h3>
    <p>
      If camera permission is requested, it is used only to allow you to capture
      photos directly inside the app (for example, to update a profile picture
      or add a family photo). Captured photos are treated the same way as other
      user-selected images and are not uploaded to any external service unless
      clearly stated by a feature you use.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      Your information is used solely to provide and improve the app’s
      family-related features, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Displaying family profiles and relationships</li>
      <li>Showing photos or media related to family members</li>
      <li>Allowing you to add, edit, or view family information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your information for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advertising or marketing</li>
      <li>Analytics or tracking outside the family app context</li>
      <li>Selling or sharing your data with third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      Family data used by this app may be stored locally on your device and/or
      on a private server controlled by the developer. We aim to use reasonable
      technical and organizational measures to protect your data, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using secure connections (for example, HTTPS) where applicable</li>
      <li>
        Restricting access to the database or backend (if any) to authorized
        users only
      </li>
      <li>Implementing authentication to prevent unauthorized access</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage
      is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> share your personal data with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advertising networks</li>
      <li>Analytics providers (outside the family context)</li>
      <li>Other third-party companies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your information is intended only for use within the family app and for
      the benefit of invited family members. We may disclose information only if
      required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>5. Permissions Used by the App</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on the features enabled, the app may request the following
      permissions:
    </p>

    <h3>5.1 Photos / Media / Files</h3>
    <p>
      Used only to let you select images from your device or display media
      inside the app. We do not access or use your photos without your action
      and consent inside the app.
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 Camera (if requested)</h3>
    <p>
      Used only to capture photos directly inside the app for purposes such as
      profile photos or family images. Camera access is never used for
      background recording or tracking.
    </p>

    <h3>5.3 Internet Access</h3>
    <p>
      If the app connects to a backend server or syncs data, internet access is
      required to send and receive that data securely.
    </p>

    <p>
      This app may contain profiles and information about children as part of
      the family tree or family records. Use of the app is intended for invited
      family members, and if a child uses the app, it should be under the
      supervision of a parent or legal guardian.

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

      Data is retained for as long as the app is in use by the family. If the
      app is discontinued or if you request deletion of your data, we will take
      reasonable steps to remove or anonymize your information.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
